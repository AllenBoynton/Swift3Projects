This app targets a user of any age that has a wish list of objects to one day own. It utilizes a simple UITableView to
list the user’s list. It also has a details view that is capable of adding, editing, and deleting an item. The use of
CoreData saves the objects locally. There is not a need to save in online storage because the user is adding entries
and there is no need for connection. The use of an IBInspectable gives the look of the table view a custom feel.
